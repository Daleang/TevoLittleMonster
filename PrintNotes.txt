17:50 9/03/2020 PETG Printing TLM Fan Bracket
Last print had bubbles and zits so I decided to try slowing down print to 40mm/s.
Also adjusted Cura settings to match recommendation: 
0.25mm Layer Height
0.5mm Line Width (Over Extrusion?)
75% Infill
Smaller Raft as last print stuck pretty well
100% Cooling fans
Print was good

Tried to print a door ninja in PETG and give it some flexible properties:
0.25mm Layer Height
1.2mm Walls
15% Cross Infill
Result was slightly messy with underextrusion on first layer, need to check layer heights or up temp from 230
